## The Problem

Standing in circles. Making small talk. Leaving events without a single genuine connection. **It's broken.**

Most networking events fail because they rely on the exact opposite of human nature—spontaneous, meaningful conversations with complete strangers.

## The Solution: Soc Ops

Soc Ops is an **interactive social bingo game** that gamifies meeting people. Give players a board. Set them loose. Watch strangers become friends.

How? By giving them **a reason to talk**—finding people who match specific prompts on their cards creates natural, purpose-driven conversations. No awkward icebreakers. Just real human connection.

## ✨ Who's It For?

**Event organizers who want to stop wasting money on mediocre networking experiences.**

| Use Case | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| 🏢 **Team Offsites** | Bridge silos. Break in new hires. Build real team culture. |
| 🎓 **Conferences** | Turn passive attendees into active connectors. 10x more meaningful interactions. |
| 🎉 **Community Events** | Build genuine community beyond small talk. Create lasting relationships. |
| 🧑‍💼 **Corporate Mixers** | Make introductions fun. Give people permission to mingle naturally. |

## 🎮 How It Works

**Simple. Engaging. Effective.**

```
1️⃣ Everyone gets a card        5×5 grid with random prompts
2️⃣ Players mingle with purpose   "Find someone who's lived in 3+ countries"
3️⃣ Track matches as they go     Click to mark connections
4️⃣ First five-in-a-row wins      But everyone leaves with new friends
```

**The magic:** Purpose-driven conversations turn strangers into connections in minutes.
