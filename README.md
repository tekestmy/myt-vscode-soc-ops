## 💡 What is Soc Ops?

Ever been to a networking event where everyone stands in circles talking to the same people they arrived with? **Not anymore.**

Soc Ops is an interactive bingo game designed for in-person gatherings. Players race to find people matching unique prompts on their board—turning strangers into connections, one square at a time.

### ✨ Perfect For

- 🏢 **Team offsites** — Help new hires break into existing cliques
- 🎓 **Conferences** — Transform passive attendees into active networkers  
- 🎉 **Community events** — Build genuine connections beyond small talk
- 🧑‍💼 **Corporate mixers** — Make introductions fun, not forced

## 🎮 How It Works

1. **Get a unique board** — Each player receives a randomized 5×5 bingo grid
2. **Mingle with purpose** — Find people matching the prompts (e.g., "Has lived in 3+ countries")
3. **Mark your squares** — Click to track your matches as you meet people
4. **Win together** — First to get 5 in a row wins (but everyone leaves with new connections)
